# Description
Simple game of Blackjack.

# Player's Rules
If the player is about to bust, but has an ace in hand, the ace automatically changes to a one.

# Dealer's Rules
1. Must stand if the total is 17 or more.
2. Must draw if the total is 16 or less.
3. Aces in dealer's hand must count as 11.

# The Play
Each person, the dealer and the player, starts out with two cards. The player can only see one of the dealer's cards. The player can stand if the total is 21 or under, or ask for another card. If the player stands, the dealer reveals its cards, and must draw if the total is 16 or less, but stand otherwise. Both the player and the dealer busts if their hand is over 21.

# Winnings
Whoever has the highest total than the other, and doesn't bust, wins.
