# #Description
Simple game of Blackjack.

##General Rules
If either the player or the dealer is about to bust, but has an ace in hand, the ace automatically changes to a one.

##Dealer's Rules
1. Must stand if the total is 17 or more.
2. Must draw if the total is 16 or less.

##The Play
Each person, the dealer and the player, starts out with two cards. The player can only see one of the dealer's cards. The player can stand if the total is 21 or under, or ask for another card. Both the player and the dealer busts when their hand is over 21.
